# Ruby on Replit

![Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35680940/211393165-1c878ea1-12e4-4f7f-a749-f3a3c7823c7e.png)

This is a template to get you started with Ruby on Replit. It's ready to go so you can just hit run and start coding!

## Running the repl

Simply hit run! You can edit the run command from the `.replit` file.

## Installing packages

To add packages to your repl, we recommend using the Replit packager interface in the left sidebar or using `bundle install` in the shell. Check out the [Bundle docs here](https://bundler.io/v2.3/#getting-started).

**Warning: Avoid using `gem install` to add packages.**

Beacuse Ruby repls use [Bundle](https://bundler.io/) under the hood to provide a consistent environment that tracks and installs the exact gems and versions needed, we recommend using `bundle install` instead of `gem install`, which may not work as expected.
